## The Game

Home is where your family is. Family leads to power. Power leads to energy. Energy leads to killing a massive shark with two arms rippling with indomitable muscles. In “JAWG”, find your family and friends to reach power levels unachievable alone. Alternatively, destroy an aquatic home playing as a mockery of nature. Run. Fight. JAWG.
